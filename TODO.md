# TODO / Known Issues

## Backend

- [ ] `StorySegmentRepository.java`  
  *File creation was blocked by tooling issues. The interface should be moved from `StoryRepository.java` to its own file when possible.*

- [ ] `FileStorageService.java`  
  *Planned for local file uploads for stories, but not yet created due to file creation issues.*

## Frontend

- [ ] `AccountSettingsScreen.tsx`  
  *File is empty or broken due to repeated tool failures. The correct UI code is in the chat history and ready to be applied.*

## General

- Review and apply all TODOs once file creation/editing is working again.
- See chat history for intended code and implementation details.
