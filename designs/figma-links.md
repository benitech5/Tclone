# UI/UX Designs for Telegram Clone

This folder contains design references for the project. Frontend developers and UI/UX designers should use this folder to share:

- Figma links
- Exported screenshots of key screens
- Design guidelines (fonts, colors, spacing, components)

## Figma Files

See [figma-links.md](./figma-links.md) for all screen designs.

## Notes

Please keep this folder organized. Do not include editable Figma files directly â€” links are preferred.
